    description: "There are several signs that can indicate that a vegetable or plant is lacking water:\n
    Wilting: The plant will appear droopy or limp, as if it is wilting. This is because the plant is not receiving enough water to maintain turgor pressure in its cells, which causes the plant to wilt.\n
    Yellowing of leaves: When a plant is lacking water, the leaves will start to turn yellow and dry, this is a clear indication that the plant is not getting enough water.\n
    Leaf drop: When a plant is stressed due to lack of water, it may shed some of its leaves as a survival mechanism.\n
    Slow growth: If a plant is not getting enough water, it may have slowed or stunted growth.\n
    Cracks in the soil: If the soil is very dry, it can become cracked, which can indicate that the plant is not getting enough water.\n
    Check the moisture of the soil: To check if the soil is dry or not, you can stick your finger in the soil, if it's dry it's a sign that the plant needs water.",
    preventatives: "When encountered with these signs, add more water. It's important to note that these signs can also be caused by other factors such as pests, diseases or environmental stress."
